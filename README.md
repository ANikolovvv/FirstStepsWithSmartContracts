# My First Steps with Smart Contracts

This repository documents my journey into blockchain development and my first steps in creating and understanding smart contracts. It includes basic Python code examples and foundational blockchain projects.

---

## **Prerequisites**

To follow along or replicate the examples in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** v18.20.3 or higher
- **Python** v3.11.9 or higher
- **Brownie** v1.20.7

---

## **Tools I Used**

- **Node.js**: For managing dependencies and running blockchain tools.
- **Python**: For writing scripts and interacting with smart contracts.
- **Brownie**: A Python-based framework for Ethereum smart contract development.
- **Ganache** (for local blockchain testing)

---

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Python Setup**
I used Python v3.11.9 for writing scripts and handling interactions with smart contracts.

You can check your Python version with:

```bash
python --version
```

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### **2. Node.js Setup**
Node.js was essential for managing blockchain dependencies and tools. Check your Node.js version with:

```bash
node --version
```

Download Node.js v18.20.3 or later from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### **3. Brownie Installation**
Brownie was my go-to framework for developing and testing smart contracts. Install it with:

```bash
pip install eth-brownie
```

Check the installed version:

```bash
brownie --version
```

For more details, visit the [Brownie documentation](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/).
